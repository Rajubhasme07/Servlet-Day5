<h4>This project is based on ServletContext and Configuration. It is used to access data stored in the ServletContext and Configuration. </h4>

The project will contain the following components: 

1. A ServletContext class that contains the configuration data needed to access the application. 

2. A Configuration class that stores the configuration settings such as database connection properties, application settings, and other relevant data. 

3. A Database Access class that provides methods for retrieving and saving data from the database. 

4. A Controller class that contains the application logic and coordinates the requests from the client and the responses to the client. 

5. A view class that will be responsible for rendering the application’s UI for the client. 

6. A utility class that contains various utility methods used throughout the application.<br><br>
